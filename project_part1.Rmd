## Overview  

In this project the exponential distribution will be investigated in R and a comparison with the Central Limit Theorem will
be provided. Lambda parameter will be set at 0.2 for all of the simulations. The distribution of averages of 40 exponentials
will be investigated. A thousand simulations will be carried out.


## Simulations 

```{r simulations, echo = TRUE}
#number of simulations
nosim <- 1000
#lambda value given
lambda <- 0.2
#number of samples
n <- 40

#set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(42)

#run exponential simulations
sim <- matrix(data = rexp(nosim * n, rate = lambda), nrow = nosim)
#apply the mean to get the mean of each row
sim_means <- apply(sim, 1, mean)
```

```{r histogram1, echo=TRUE, fig.height=6, fig.width=8}
#plot the histogram
hist(sim_means, col = "steelblue")
```
